# front-end-test

### This web application is part of a test done for MD Digital Solutions.

I have done it with simple CSS, HTML, and Vanilla JavaScript. I have also worked with several libraries with different purposes:

* Axios: it helped me to request data from the APIs of https://weatherstack.com and https://mediastack.com.
* Aos: it helped me to add fade effects so that the navigation may be smoother and more appealing.
* GSAP: I've used it in order to fade the header every time the page renders. 
* Micromodal: I've included this library in the blog section to open the videos on a modal.
* Lottiefiles: this awesome library allowed me to add different cool animations that were specially customized for my website in the editor of https://lottiefiles.com/
* Ioicons: this provided me with icons for the footer.
* Bootstrap Icons: I've used it for my 'icon-logo'.
* Tasty CSS-animated hamburgers: this helped me to animate the menu hamburger for the responsive navbar when used on small screens. 

Apart from these libraries, the design and code were done completely by me. I really enjoyed making this website in just two days. I would have liked to add more stuff and improve both the code and design. However, whether I pass this test or not, I will probably come back to this piece of code since I had a good time, solving problems and catching bugs.
